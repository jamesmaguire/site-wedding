Alex and James met at unigames... We were friends for a while, and then started
dating. From there we attended nationals together. We travelled to Auckland for
a year, where we played NZ nationals and then Christchurch, where we played NZ
mixed nationals. Now we are best friends, not just frisbee friends.
